The black in computer science
1. Background
2. Reasons
3. Solutions

According to my expirence, I didn't see a lot of black students in computer science major. Technology companies employ strikingly few black and Hispanic workers. They blame the recruitment pipeline, saying there aren’t enough of them graduating with relevant degrees and applying for tech jobs(Example, phd in computer sicence).  Data show that there are many more black and Hispanic students majoring in computer science and engineering than work in tech jobs. Among young computer science and engineering graduates with bachelor’s or advanced degrees 6 percent are black. In google, twitter 1 percent black.

Understanding Career Choice of African American Men Majoring in Information Technology

(1) Those who studied science and technology were less likely than white students to stick with their majors when they felt they were underperforming, sometimes because they had heard negative things about the culture at tech companies, and seen how few black people worked there.

(2)“There definitely isn’t a pipeline problem, even going to the same schools companies go to,” Mr. Walker said. He puts the onus on the companies. “These folks aren’t working hard enough, they’re just not.”

(3) When companies come to campus to recruit, for example, black and Hispanic students often simply don’t show up for information sessions, Ms. Powers said. But they’re more likely to come to workshops, like for writing résumés or preparing for interviews.

(4) Tech companies often give coders whiteboard interviews — asking them to solve a problem by writing code on a whiteboard, so the interviewers can see their thought process. At Code 2040, however, they discovered that many black and Hispanic students, unlike white and Asian ones, had never heard of this type of interview and were unprepared for it.

(5) “There’s still a dominant cultural narrative in black and Hispanic communities that you have to be twice as good and keep your head down and work hard,” Ms. Powers said. “That does not translate to Valley culture, starting with the whiteboard interview,” because it requires people to work through errors in front of the interviewer, as opposed to presenting only the right answer.

(6)  there have been only three papers presented at a SIGMIS conference that have dealt with the topic of under represented groups in the IT profession by focusing on African American men

Sometimes there's no right and wrong but just different thinkings.


Solution:
(1) Online study. less expensive, people can share computers.
(2) Ignore the rumors.
(3) People need to sacrifice
